# MoJo Distance Measure - Release 2.0

The MoJo Metric and this source code is based on the implementation found at [https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~bil/downloads/mojo.tar](Â https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~bil/downloads/mojo.tar)



If the two decompositions do not refer to the same set of clustered objects, only the intersection of the two sets will be considered.

Feel free to send email to bil@cse.yorku.ca with any questions. The algorithm that calculates the MoJo distance was developed by Zhihua Wen.



## Bunch Files 

The MoJo algorithm takes as input `.bunch` files of the form:

```
Cluster0 = M0, M1, M2
Cluster1 = M3, M4
```
